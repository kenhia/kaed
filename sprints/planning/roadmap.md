# Roadmap

> The general plan for this project. Keep it current; detail lives in the
> sprint records. Design docs: [summary](summary.md) · [overview](overview.md)
> · [mcp-contract](mcp-contract.md) · [architecture](architecture.md).

## Now

- **Sprint 002 — blast-radius hardening** (proposal in korg). The live
  test's findings, mostly server-side and small: explicit project roots
  instead of `$HOME` and/or a resolver-level denylist (#908), RFC 6750
  error attributes on 401s (#913), a stance on journal blobs retaining
  credentials and third-party pre-images (#909), conflict/rollback
  visibility in the journal (#910), the token-rotation story decision
  before fleet deploy (#914), and contract wording for version
  durability — content-derived, survives restarts/rotation (#915).
  Directly unblocks adding roots and clients.

## Next

- **History tools:** `journal`, `diff`, `revert` + blob retention.
- **Structure:** tree-sitter `outline` + `node_replace` + `check` parse
  diagnostics (rust, markdown, toml first).
- **`feedback` tool** — then act on it: first contract revision driven by
  real agent friction reports.
- **Remaining edit ops:** `insert`, `delete`, `rename`; `window`-mode and
  `numbered` reads if not already in 001.
- **Fleet deploy:** kubs0 + kubsdb; k-homelab recipe for install/config;
  korg project registration and sprint flow from there.
- **Dogfood report:** a written comparison (round-trips, failures, token
  cost) of kaed vs rclone-mount vs base64-over-ssh on real editing tasks
  — the evidence for whether the bet is paying off.

## Later / Ideas

- `apply_patch` (unified-diff input) if dogfooding misses it.
- Check hooks beyond parse: fmt/lint/`just check` integration in the edit
  response.
- LSP bridge: rename-symbol, find-references, live diagnostics.
- Leases/locks — only if optimistic versioning shows real contention.
- ksandbox deployment.
- Local (cleo) kaed as an opt-in power tool alongside built-in editing
  tools — the "if we got it right" bet; needs the dogfood report first.
- Per-region versioning for conflict-free disjoint edits.
- MCP resources/subscriptions; metrics & observability; binary/non-UTF-8
  handling; journal → korg feedback promotion automation.

## Done

- **Sprint 001 — walking skeleton** (2026-08-02). The six core tools,
  R1–R4 semantics, atomic apply, journal writes, bearer auth over
  streamable HTTP; deployed to kai (systemd user unit + tailscale
  serve) and verified end-to-end from Desktop Claude on cleo. Record:
  `sprints/001-walking-skeleton/`; contract clarifications in its
  `contract-notes.md`; follow-up WIs #908–#911, #913, #914.
